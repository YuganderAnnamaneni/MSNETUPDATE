Develop a parking system, identify the classes and the relation between them. 
For e.g. 

Parking System - class, has collection of the floors
            Floor  - has collection of the parking slots
                        Parking Slots
                                    Parking slot could keep cars
                                                Car - generic class - Different kind of cars  Car<BMW>, Car<Toyota> 
												
You could modify/extend it as per your ideas but the concept should be to implement a parking system.
Also, it should have the following methods.

1) To get the count of all available (free) parking slots for a floor
2) To get count of all the available (free) parking slots for all floors
3) To get count of total parking slots for the system (filled or vacant - all)
4) To park a car in a available (free) slot and the count should reduce by 1
5) To unpark a car in a available (free) slot and the count should reduce by 1
