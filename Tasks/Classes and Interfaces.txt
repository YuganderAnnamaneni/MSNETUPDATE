Family Tree Structure.

Create the console Application, name should be FamilyTreeStructure

Requirements:
	1. Create IFamilyTree interface which contains the following methods: 
		- Create() - returns the instance of FamilyTree class
		- ShowTree() - Print out the tree-viewed representation to the console (feel free to choose: vertical, horizontal, etc.)
		- SearchByName() - returns formatted string - 'First Name - Last Name [Date of birth](dd/mm/yyyy) - [Date of death](dd/mm/yyyy)(if applicable)'
						 - SearchByName performs full text search: if we have person with name "John Smith", on searching by (for example) 'hn' or 'mit', instance "John Smith" should be returned
						 - if multiple options possible, result have to be showed on the different lines

	2. Create FamilyTree class, which implements IFamilyTree and which contains the following information:

						'First Name - Last Name [Date of birth](dd/mm/yyyy) - [Date of death](dd/mm/yyyy)(if applicable)'
		- AddParent() - add parent, which parent - depends on the gender
